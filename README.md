2. It's a year 2080 and multiplanetary travel is on the rise. Given an age on
Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds, calculate
Earth years of a 631,154,000 seconds year old Space traveller in Space
planets, given:

● Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
● Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
● Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years.
● Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years.

Eg:A Space traveller is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say
that “Earth age : 31.69 Earth-years old - Mars age: 16.8 Earth-years old”.
Use methods to solve this Exercise.

3. Commit and push these changes from your local repository to remote your
repository
